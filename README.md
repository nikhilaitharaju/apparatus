# Apparatus Marketing Website

Nik and Ryo are working on a project together, and this is a site that describes the project.

Apparatus is a tool to automatically track the impact of SEO/CRO experiments with almost zero setup or additional overhead. Our value prop for growth marketers is that we can help you run more experiments and learn faster, so that you can drive business.


## Getting Started

This site uses Gulp for building and Slim for templating.

### Installing

Clone the repo down, then run 

```
npm install #installs gulp

gulp # builds the site, using /source and compiles to /dist
```

## Deployment

We are using Netlify to deploy this, so simply push to the master branch, and it will update the site live. Build configurations are stored in the Netlify dashboard.
